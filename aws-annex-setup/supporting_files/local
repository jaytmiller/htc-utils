# EVENT_LOG setup for tracking job events
# ------------------------------------------------------------------

# From: https://htcondor.readthedocs.io/en/v8_9_5/admin-manual/configuration-macros.html

# EVENT_LOG

# The full path and file name of the event log. There is no default
# value for this variable, so no event log will be written, if not
# defined.

EVENT_LOG = /var/log/condor/EventLog

# EVENT_LOG_MAX_SIZE

# 4G of events based on seeing 10 sleep jobs weigh in at 55k with minimal info
EVENT_LOG_MAX_SIZE = 4294967296

# Controls the maximum length in bytes to which the event log will be
# allowed to grow. The log file will grow to the specified length, then
# be saved to a file with the suffix .old. The .old files are
# overwritten each time the log is saved. A value of 0 specifies that
# the file may grow without bounds (and disables rotation). The default
# is 1 MiB.

# EVENT_LOG_MAX_ROTATIONS

# Controls the maximum number of rotations of the event log that will be
# stored. If this value is 1 (the default), the event log will be
# rotated to a “.old” file as described above. However, if this is
# greater than 1, then multiple rotation files will be stores, up to
# EVENT_LOG_MAX_ROTATIONS of them. These files will be named, instead of
# the “.old” suffix, “.1”, “.2”, with the “.1” being the most recent
# rotation. This is an integer parameter with a default value of 1. If
# EVENT_LOG is not defined, or if EVENT_LOG_MAX_SIZE has a value of 0
# (which disables event log rotation), this parameter has no effect.

# EVENT_LOG_ROTATION_LOCK

# Specifies the lock file that will be used to ensure that, when
# rotating files, the rotation is done by a single process. This is a
# string parameter; its default value is $(LOCK)/EventLogLock. If an
# empty value is set, then the file that is used is the file path of the
# event log itself, with the string .lock appended. If EVENT_LOG is not
# defined, or if EVENT_LOG_MAX_SIZE has a value of 0 (which disables
# event log rotation), this configuration variable has no effect.

# EVENT_LOG_FSYNC

# A boolean value that controls whether HTCondor will perform an fsync()
# after writing each event to the event log. When True, an fsync()
# operation is performed after each event. This fsync() operation forces
# the operating system to synchronize the updates to the event log to
# the disk, but can negatively affect the performance of the
# system. Defaults to False.

# EVENT_LOG_LOCKING

# A boolean value that defaults to False on Unix platforms and True on
# Windows platforms. When True, the event log (as specified by
# EVENT_LOG) will be locked before being written to. When False,
# HTCondor does not lock the file before writing.

# EVENT_LOG_COUNT_EVENTS

# A boolean value that is False by default. When True, upon rotation of
# the user’s job event log, a count of the number of job events is taken
# by scanning the log, such that the newly created, post-rotation user
# job event log will have this count in its header. This configuration
# variable is relevant when rotation of the user’s job event log is
# enabled.

# EVENT_LOG_FORMAT_OPTIONS

# A list of case-insensitive keywords that control formatting of the log
# events and of timestamps for the log specified by EVENT_LOG. Use zero
# or one of the following formatting options:

# XML    -  Log events in XML format. This has the same effect EVENT_LOG_USE_XML below
# JSON   -  Log events in JSON format. This conflicts with EVENT_LOG_USE_XML below

# And zero or more of the following option flags:

# UTC

# Log event timestamps as Universal Coordinated Time. The time value
# will be printed with a timezone value of Z to indicate that times are
# UTC.

# ISO_DATE

# Log event timestamps in ISO 8601 format. This format includes a 4
# digit year and is printed in a way that makes sorting by date easier.

ISO_DATE = 1

# SUB_SECOND

# Include fractional seconds in event timestamps.

SUB_SECOND = 1

# LEGACY

# Set all time formatting flags to be compatible with older versions of
# HTCondor.  All of the above options are case-insensitive, and can be
# preceeded by a ! to invert their meaning, so configuring !UTC,
# !ISO_DATE, !SUB_SECOND gives the same result as configuring LEGACY.

# EVENT_LOG_USE_XML

# A boolean value that defaults to False. When True, events are logged
# in XML format. If EVENT_LOG is not defined, this parameter has no
# effect.

# --------------------------------------------------------------------

# EVENT_LOG_JOB_AD_INFORMATION_ATTRS

# A comma separated list of job ClassAd attributes, whose evaluated
# values form a new event, the JobAdInformationEvent, given Event Number
# 028. This new event is placed in the event log in addition to each
# logged event. If EVENT_LOG is not defined, this configuration variable
# has no effect. This configuration variable is the same as the job
# ClassAd attribute JobAdInformationAttrs (see Job ClassAd Attributes),
# but it applies to the system Event Log rather than the user job log.

# See: https://htcondor.readthedocs.io/en/v8_9_5/classad-attributes/job-classad-attributes.html
