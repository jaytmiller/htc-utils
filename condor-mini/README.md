# Condor Mini

## Overview

Condor-mini is a stripped down version of the excellent but large
https://github.com/htcondor/htc-minimal-notebook.

The goal of condor-mini is to enable development of condor based
systems using containers to store the master node and some token
number of workers.   To reduce the size of the image/container,
condor-mini strips out JupyterLab, one of the main puposes of
htc-minimal-notebook,  leaving only the personal condor.

## Architecture

Condor-mini consists of a small stack of two images based directly
on the architecture of htc-minimal-notebook:

- condor-base is based on Ubuntu and a barebones miniconda installation.

- condor-mini adds a personal htcondor system to condor-base.

## Building

Building can be performed by running the root build script to
build both components:  condor-base and condor-mini.

```$ ./build```

Child build scripts also exist to aid development on either component
seperately.

## Running

Running condor-mini can be accomplished by executing:

```
$ ./run
Started HTCondor

jovyan@68e47ed84c73:~$ condor_restart

By default this will start htcondor and place the user at an interactive
bash prompt.


## Logs and Condor State

The logs and other condor state are stored in the subdirectory
condor_state which is bind mounted to the condor-mini docker container
at runtime.
